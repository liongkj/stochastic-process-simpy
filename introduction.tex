Your final Report should be no longer than 8,000 words. The word limit applies to the main text area only, as this is where your report is introduced and then carried forward. Your final word-count should not include: title page, synopsis, acknowledgements, list of contents, notation (if applicable), references, bibliography or appendix/appendices. Shorter Reports are allowed depending on the nature of the research (for example some mathematical and statistical projects are usually shorter than qualitative projects). Reports longer than 8,000 words will be penalised.\\
\\
If the Report is to contain a considerable number of tables and figures, it may be best to place them in an appendix and use in the main text only such summary tables or charts as will assist the reader in following your arguments without necessarily having to go into great detail. This may help to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted presentation.\\
