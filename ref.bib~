  abstract      = {Queueing networks with blocking have proved useful in modelling of data communications and production lines. We study such a network consisting of a sequence of two service stations with an infinite queue allowed before the first station and no intermediate queue allowed between them. This restriction results in the blocking of the first station whenever a unit having completed its service in that station cannot enter into the second one due to the presence of another unit there. The input of units to the network is the MAP (Markovian Arrival Process). At the first station, service requirements are of phase type whereas service times at the second station are arbitrarily distributed. The focus is on the embedded process at departures. The essential tool in our analysis is the general theory on Markov renewal processes of M/G/1-type.},
