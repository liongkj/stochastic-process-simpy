	In this study, we simulate the blocking problem in fast food chain and analyze the impacts of the service interaction and customer experience. We showed that the multi-tandem stage system has a correlation between the blocking and waiting times at the following stages for later customers. Based on personal experience and reviews from Google, the queue length and expected queue time increases significantly during lunch hours or when the restaurants offer limited merchandise in happy meals, long queue is  more common in KFC restaurants because of the efficiency of queuing system used compared to MCD. Although in practice, KFC servers most probably will ask the customer to wait aside while taking order for the next customer, simulation results still proved that MCD wait queuing system is more efficient, reduced wait times, have better staff utilization, customer flow management and minimizing operational cost.
