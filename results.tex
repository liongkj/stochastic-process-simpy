In the simulation, the system with stage blocking are assigned to the name \textbf{FIFO} whereas the system without stage blocking are assigned with the name \textbf{TICKET}
\subsection{System utilization rate}
With $\lambda = 3$, $\mu = 1.5$ we plot the graph of how the number of servers affect the efficiency of each server. \textbf{FIFO} system

\subsection{The average number of customers waiting in line}

The simulation results in left diagram in \ref{mean_queue_length} shows that average queue length of \textbf{FIFO} has the higher exponential rate of increase when arrival rate $\lambda$ increases compared to the \textbf{TICKET} system. The right graph also showed similar results when the service rate $\mu$ decreases, customers in \textbf{FIFO} system will have higher probability of facing longer queue. 

Indeed, the \textbf{FIFO} system with blocking is observed to be more easily affected by the increase of arrival rate (i.e. lunch hour) or decrease of service rate (staff shortage).

\subsection{Average time of a customer spend in the system}

The average time of a customer spend in the system includes both queuing and service time. The simulation results shows similar conclusion where customers in  \textbf{FIFO} system has a higher probability of spending more time in the system.
