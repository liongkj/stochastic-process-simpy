I am eternally grateful to my advisor, Prof. Shi Jian Hong for explaining about stochastic processes and queuing theory which provided me a good understanding and knowledge to complete this project. I would also like to thank my friend for her willingness to proof read and provide useful suggestions for my work. Finally, I would like to thank SJTU for allowing us to proceed our studies online in times of hardship like this and the canvas technical teams for the great support during our semester.

Last but not least, I also gain much knowledge and experience on how to model real life problems into computer simulation which is very useful for my later studies.
